6. **Formatting**:
    - Avoid grouping (e.g., "Cloud Computing" → list "AWS", "Azure").
    - Avoid redundancy (e.g., "Azure" and "Azure Services").
    - Use title case for names (e.g., "TensorFlow" instead of "tensorflow").
    - Ensure each line in the JSON output has a maximum of **120 characters**, including spaces, for better readability.
    - Ensure the output is professional and concise.

7. **Additional Context**:
    - Tailor the skills section to align closely with the job description for ATS (Applicant Tracking System) optimization.
    - Ensure the skills selection and formatting enhance visual appeal while meeting the specified limits.
    - Bluffing should be realistic, plausible, and supportable during an interview.

    - Correct any **missing or incorrect** details, such as **incorrect dates**, **GPA** discrepancies, or **incomplete coursework**.
    - If any detail is missing from the JD (e.g., missing certifications or relevant coursework), update accordingly."""

        #### General Validation Rules:
        1. Remove placeholders (e.g., "xxx", "yyy") or null/empty fields.
        2. Ensure all fields match the resume content. If there is a mismatch, correct it to align with the resume.
        3. Format all text consistently (e.g., capitalization, punctuation, formatting).
        4. Align data with the job description (JD), prioritizing relevance to the role.
        5. Quantify outcomes, add measurable results where applicable, and use action-oriented language.
